# Introduction to Aelecair.



The use of normal aircrafts for traveling short distances has significantly destroyed the environment by releasing high levels of carbon dioxide which has, in turn, caused many problems.

Aelecair aims to reduce the problems caused, by increasing the awareness of using electric airplanes in place of normal aircrafts for traveling short distances. The app aims to make people aware of the importance and advantages of using electric airplanes over normal aircrafts for traveling. 

The app aims to do so by not only making people aware of how less carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by traveling through electric planes but also through a realistic simulator. Also, the use of an API from OpenSky helped us to display real-time data of CO2 emission in a day and in an hour.
